# React Bootstrap Typeahead

A [React](https://reactjs.org/)-based typeahead that relies on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling and was originally inspired by Twitter's [typeahead.js](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js). It supports both single- and multi-selection and is compliant with [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#combobox). Try the [live examples](http://ericgio.github.io/react-bootstrap-typeahead/).
